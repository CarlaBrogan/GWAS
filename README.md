GWAS Autism Genome Project
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are early-onset lifelong neurodevelopmental disorders that are characterised by social and communication deficits and are accompanied by fixated interests and repetitive behaviours.  Updated diagnostic criteria partition autism behavioural traits into these two domains and, while psychiatric disorders are largely clinical-historical constructs, they are potentially informative for a phenotype.  

Consequently these symptom domains were subjected to data mining to produce quantitative phenotype scores which were then applied to genomic data in a GWAS to provide insight into how, or if, these phenotypes relate to the underlying genetic architecture.  

Autism is a highly heritable disorder: twin studies put the heritability estimate as high as 90% (Gupta & State 2007) and SNP-heritability estimates have been observed at >65% (Klei et al. 2012) but GWAS, copy number and sequence-based studies have failed to account for more than ~10% of the heritability (Abrahams & Geschwind 2008).  The possibility that the heritability is being obscured by autismâ€™s considerable heterogeneity provides the incentive to use the derived phenotype scores to assess the proportion of genotypic variance that can be attributed to variance in these phenotypes.
